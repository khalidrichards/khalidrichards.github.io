*If you've found this site, I assume you want to know a bit more about me!*

## Who am I?

I'm a **software engineer** @ **Google**. (If you've ever noticed some of the additional features on health-related searches,
that's the team I'm on!) Besides what I do to keep bread on the table, I also enjoy baking, have recently gotten into weightlifting and rugby, and am a huge gaming fanatic (ask me about the game I'm working on!).

## What are you currently working on? 
If you're interested in my professional, day-to-day work, you can check out [my resume]({{link_to_resume}}).

Otherwise, stand by for additional information on some of the projects I do outside of work that bring me joy!
